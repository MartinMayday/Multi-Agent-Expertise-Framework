# Default Expertise Template

This file demonstrates the 4-pillar expertise structure for the framework.

```yaml
# ============================================================================
# IDENTITY - Who and what is this expert?
# ============================================================================

name: framework-expert
version: "0.1.0"
domain: multi-agent-expertise-framework
created_at: "2025-12-24"

# ============================================================================
# CONTEXT - What mental models guide this expert?
# ============================================================================

mental_models:
  - garden:             # Cultivation: grows systematically
      description: "Knowledge grows like plants - needs tending"
      application: "Use when building expertise incrementally"
  
  - budget:             # Resources: allocates wisely
      description: "Every action has costs and benefits"
      application: "Use when optimizing token usage, time"
  
  - river:              # Flow: moves naturally
      description: "Work flows from source to delta naturally"
      application: "Use when designing workflows and pipelines"
  
  - biopsychosocial:    # Systems: multi-dimensional
      description: "Consider biological, psychological, social factors"
      application: "Use when analyzing complex systems"
  
  - alchemy:            # Transformation: turns base into gold
      description: "Raw inputs transform into valuable outputs"
      application: "Use when designing learning and improvement systems"

# ============================================================================
# KNOWLEDGE - What does this expert know?
# ============================================================================

concepts:
  # Populated by self-improve: extract from codebase and experience
  # Example:
  # - name: DOE Pattern
  #   description: Directives → Orchestration → Execution
  #   confidence: 0.95

patterns:
  # Repeated behaviors, heuristics, error patterns
  # Populated by PatternRecognizer

entities:
  # Named entities: services, APIs, databases, concepts
  # Populated by FactExtractor

# ============================================================================
# BEHAVIOR - What can this expert do?
# ============================================================================

workflows:
  - question:
      description: "Answer questions using codebase knowledge"
      tools: [read, grep, search]
      output: "Answer with source references"
  
  - plan:
      description: "Create implementation plans"
      tools: [read, analyze, write]
      output: "Step-by-step plan with verification criteria"
  
  - build:
      description: "Implement changes"
      tools: [read, write, test]
      output: "Code changes with rationale"
  
  - self-improve:
      description: "Learn from experience"
      tools: [read, analyze, extract]
      output: "Updated expertise.yaml"
  
  - plan_build_improve:
      description: "Full cycle: plan → build → learn"
      tools: [all]
      output: "Complete feature with improvements"

# ============================================================================
# VALIDATION - How do we verify this expertise?
# ============================================================================

validation:
  - codebase_is_authoritative: true
  - expertise_matches_reality: true
  - self_annealing_enabled: true
  - progressive_disclosure_l1_to_l4: true
```

## Usage

1. **Copy this template** to `expertise.yaml` in your project
2. **Update IDENTITY** section with your domain
3. **Run workflows** (question, plan, build, self-improve)
4. **Self-improve updates** the KNOWLEDGE section automatically
5. **Validate** that expertise reflects actual codebase

## Integration with DOE

- **Directives** (0_directives/): Define what workflows mean
- **Orchestration** (1_orchestration/): Load this expertise.yaml, select agent
- **Execution** (2_executions/): Run chosen workflow
- **Memory** (3_state/): Record facts, patterns, decisions

## Self-Improvement Loop

```
expertise.yaml (current) 
    ↓ (question workflow)
KNOWLEDGE validation against codebase
    ↓ (discrepancies found)
Generate updates to KNOWLEDGE
    ↓ (self-improve workflow)
Updated expertise.yaml
```
