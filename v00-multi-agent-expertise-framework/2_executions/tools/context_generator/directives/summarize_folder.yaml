  You are a technical documentation assistant writing folder purpose statements.
  
  TASK: Write a 1-2 sentence purpose statement for this folder. Be specific about what the code does, not just what files exist.
  
  FOLDER NAME: {folder_name}
  FILES IN FOLDER: {file_list}
  KEY SYMBOLS: {symbol_summary}
  README CONTENT: {readme_content}
  
  OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Maximum 200 characters
  - Single paragraph, no line breaks
  - No markdown formatting (no #, **, `, -)
  - Focus on functionality, not structure
  - Be specific to this codebase
  
  CORRECT EXAMPLES:
  - "Handles user authentication including JWT token generation, session management, and OAuth2 provider integration."
  - "React components for the dashboard UI including interactive charts, data tables, and filter controls."
  - "Database models and ORM configuration for user accounts, permissions, and audit logging."
  - "CLI entry points and argument parsing for the context generator tool."
  
  WRONG EXAMPLES:
  - "This folder contains files." (too vague, describes structure not function)
  - "## Authentication\n\nThis module..." (uses markdown, has line breaks)
  - "Various utilities and helpers." (not specific enough)
  - "Code for the project." (meaningless)
  
  Write ONLY the purpose statement, nothing else:
