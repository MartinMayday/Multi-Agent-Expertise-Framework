# Temporary Documentation

This directory contains temporary documentation files created during the scaffold deployment process. These files document the deployment status, structure verification, and organization details.

## Contents

- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` - Deployment status confirmation
- `FILE_ORGANIZATION.md` - File organization guide
- `FINAL_STRUCTURE.md` - Structure verification details
- `SCAFFOLD_COMPLETE.md` - Scaffold completion summary
- `SEPARATION_COMPLETE.md` - File separation status

## Purpose

These files were created to track the deployment process and verify the scaffold structure. They are retained for reference but are not essential for the production OS operation.

## Production Files

Essential production files remain in the root directory:
- `FRAMEWORK.md` - Core system specification
- `AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_CONTRACT.md` - System contract
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent catalog
- `FRAMEWORK-CHECKLIST.md` - Deployment checklist
- `README.md` - Quick start guide
