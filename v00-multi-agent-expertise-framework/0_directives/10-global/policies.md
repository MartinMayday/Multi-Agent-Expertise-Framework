## 1. Security & PII
All agents must adhere to strict data privacy standards. No personally identifiable information (PII) should be stored in memory files or persistent logs.

## 2. Code Quality
Implementation tools must follow the project's style guides and pass all validation checks before being promoted from staging.

## 3. Tool Access
Tools are restricted to their specific domains. Any tool execution outside of its defined scope must be logged as a security incident.
