# How to Update Memory

## When to Update
- After a successful task completion (record patterns/facts).
- After a failure (record incident and prevention rules).
- When user preferences change.
- When new architectural decisions are made.

## Update Guidelines
- **Be Concise**: Use bullet points and clear language.
- **Maintain Structure**: Never delete XML tags or headers.
- **Future Self Test**: Only record information that will help your "future self" in another session.
- **No Duplication**: Check existing memory before adding new entries.
