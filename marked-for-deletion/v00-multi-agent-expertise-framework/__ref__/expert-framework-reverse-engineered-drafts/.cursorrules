# Cursor IDE Project Rules - Entrypoint

This project implements a **file-based agentic workflow OS** where AI acts as orchestrator over deterministic Python tools.

## Authoritative Specifications

Read these files first for complete system understanding:
- `AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_CONTRACT.md` - Filesystem-as-API contract, permissions, ownership
- `FRAMEWORK.md` - Complete system architecture and orchestration patterns
- `FRAMEWORK-CHECKLIST.md` - Deployment validation criteria
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent catalog and capabilities

## Non-Negotiable Principles

1. **No assumptions** - All responses must trace to documentation, KB, or execution results
2. **KB-first execution** - Check `shared-knowledgebase/manifest.md` before answering; declare KB_STATUS
3. **Cite files** - Reference specific file paths when making claims
4. **No secrets** - Never commit tokens/keys; use `.env` files (excluded from context)
5. **Staging-only writes** - ALL new/changed files MUST be written to `review-approval/` or `staging/` first. Direct writes to canonical locations require explicit user permission.
6. **Filesystem-as-API** - New artifacts go to: `directives/`, `executions/`, `shared-knowledgebase/`, `agents/` (after staging approval)
7. **Root hygiene** - Root directory reserved for essential runtime docs only

## Detailed Rules

For complete behavioral guidance, see:
- `.cursor/rules/project_rules.mdc` - Comprehensive project rules with enforcement checkpoints

## Slash Commands

Reusable commands available via `.cursor/commands/`:
- `/validate-scaffold` - Validate OS structure
- `/scaffold-os` - Regenerate scaffold
- `/kb-first-answer` - Enforce KB gate before responding
- `/create-kb-snippet` - Generate KB snippet in standard format
- `/handoff` - Emit formal handoff contract
- `/create-execution-tool` - Scaffold new Python tool
- `/create-execution-workflow` - Scaffold new workflow
- `/failure-triage` - Standard failure response protocol
- `/eval-maturity` - Run or request evaluation tooling
- `/plan-build-self-improve` - Execute plan→build→self-improve loop

## Context Exclusion

Files in `.cursorignore` are excluded from context by default (original-repo/, marked-for-deletion/, caches, logs, .env files).
