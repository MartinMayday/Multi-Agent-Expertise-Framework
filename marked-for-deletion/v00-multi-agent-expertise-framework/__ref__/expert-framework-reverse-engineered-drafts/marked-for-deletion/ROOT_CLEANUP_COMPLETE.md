# Root Directory Cleanup Complete ✅

**Date**: 2024-12-23  
**Status**: Only production-essential files remain in root

## What Was Done

Moved all temporary/conversation documentation files from root to `marked-for-deletion/`:

### Moved Files
- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` → `marked-for-deletion/`
- `FILE_ORGANIZATION.md` → `marked-for-deletion/`
- `FINAL_STRUCTURE.md` → `marked-for-deletion/`
- `SCAFFOLD_COMPLETE.md` → `marked-for-deletion/`
- `SEPARATION_COMPLETE.md` → `marked-for-deletion/`

## Root Directory Now Contains

### Production Files (5)
1. `FRAMEWORK.md` - Core system specification
2. `AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_CONTRACT.md` - System contract
3. `AGENTS.md` - Agent catalog
4. `FRAMEWORK-CHECKLIST.md` - Deployment checklist
5. `README.md` - Quick start guide

### Core Directories
- `src/` - Core library
- `scripts/` - Deployment scripts
- `directives/` - Behavior contracts
- `executions/` - Python tools
- `shared-knowledgebase/` - Knowledge base
- `agents/` - Agent definitions
- `sessions/`, `eval/`, `test/`, `logs/`, `planning/` - Supporting directories
- `marked-for-deletion/` - Temporary documentation
- `original-repo/` - Original reference files

## Result

✅ Root directory is clean and production-focused  
✅ Only essential files visible  
✅ Temporary documentation preserved in `marked-for-deletion/`  
✅ Scaffold validation still passes
