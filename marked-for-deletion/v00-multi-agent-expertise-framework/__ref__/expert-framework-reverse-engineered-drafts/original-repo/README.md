- Understanding the original framework concepts
- Future reference if needed

## New Structure

The newly scaffolded file-based agentic workflow OS is in the parent directory:
- `src/` - Core library
- `scripts/` - Deployment scripts
- `directives/` - Behavior contracts
- `executions/` - Python tools
- `agents/` - Agent definitions
- `shared-knowledgebase/` - Knowledge base
- etc.

See parent directory for the complete OS structure.
