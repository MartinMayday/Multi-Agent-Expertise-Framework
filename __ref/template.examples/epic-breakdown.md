/epic-breakdown

**Purpose**: Structure large initiatives into executable agile epics with features and user stories

**Instructions**:
You are creating an execution EPIC for an agile project. Follow this structure:

1. **Epic Definition**
   - Tie epic to broader initiative/project roadmap
   - Define epic from stakeholder/client perspective (not technical implementation)
   - Establish acceptance criteria for epic completion
   - Set epic timeframe: 3-12 months span across multiple sprints

2. **Epic Hierarchy**
   - Epic (strategic initiative)
     └─ Features (testable functionality)
        └─ User Stories (sprint-sized work)
           └─ Tasks (implementation steps)

3. **Epic Components**
   - **Objective**: What business problem does this solve?
   - **Success Metrics**: How do we measure epic completion?
   - **Features**: List 3-7 major features that comprise the epic
   - **Dependencies**: What other epics/teams does this depend on?
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, measurable outcomes

4. **Execution Planning**
   - Break into sprint-ready increments
   - Assign priority levels (critical/important/optional)
   - Identify cross-functional requirements
   - Plan continuous delivery milestones

5. **Tracking Requirements**
   - Link features to user stories in hierarchy view
   - Update status via automated workflows
   - Maintain epics roadmap across quarters/releases
   - Visualize progress with Kanban/sprint boards

**Output Format**:
- Epic specification (Markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- Feature breakdown hierarchy (nested lists)
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- Sprint allocation timeline (Gantt chart)

**Quality Checks**:
- Epic has clear stakeholder value
- Features are independently testable
- User stories fit within 1-2 sprint cycles
- Acceptance criteria are measurable
